# KWIC
Software Architecture 

Key Word In Context (KWIC) is a term project for UCO's Software Architecture and Design class.

The main goal of the application is to take an input string, rotate the word order by placing the first word at the end. 
This process is repeated until we return to the original first word. All possible strings are then alphabetized. 

Through the iterations of this project our team explored different types of Software Architecture, including Pipe and Filter,
Shared Data, and Client Server.
